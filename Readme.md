# Wordle Solver
## Taylor Noah

I created two types of Wordle solvers for fun! One kind uses statistics to choose the most likely guess. The other uses machine learning to make it's decisions.

The primary component, player, uses selenium to use the web browser and interact with the game. Player uses one of the decision models above to make its choice!

Ah but how can I do both in one day?? Differnet browwsers, probably. Incognito maybe?

To start, I copied the lists from the source code and created shuffled versions of them.
